#Supported cars
Ideally, anything with a JECS 93-pin ECU that supports Subaru Select Monitor (SSM1 or SSM2).

Will primarily test against OBD2 cars for ease of acquisition of the cable and test parts.

#TODO
 * [x] Devise some initial protocol details
 * [ ] Port to Go
 * [ ] Build test harness for JECS 93-pin ECU
 * [ ] Test on pre- and post-checksum ECUs
 * [ ] Develop tools for intelligent diffs of ECU dumps
